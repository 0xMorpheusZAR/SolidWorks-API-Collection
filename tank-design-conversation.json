          "text": "API 650 is a standard from the **American Petroleum Institute (API)** that provides guidelines for the design, fabrication, erection, and inspection of welded steel tanks used for oil storage. It is a globally recognized standard that ensures the safety, durability, and environmental performance of these structures.\n\n### Scope and Applications\n\nAPI 650 applies specifically to **vertical, cylindrical, aboveground, welded storage tanks** with a uniformly supported bottom. These tanks can be of the open- or closed-top variety. The standard is intended for tanks operating at or near atmospheric pressure, with a maximum internal pressure not exceeding 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge (psig). The standard design temperature is up to 200°F (93°C), although higher temperatures can be accommodated with a special annex.\n\nWhile the title specifies \"oil storage,\" the applications of API 650 extend to a wide range of industries and stored products, including:\n* **Petroleum and Petrochemicals:** Crude oil, gasoline, diesel, and other refined products.\n* **Chemicals:** A wide variety of liquid chemicals.\n* **Water:** Both potable and process water storage.\n* **Biofuels:** Ethanol and other biofuels.\n\n### Key Design Principles\n\nThe design of an API 650 tank is based on several key principles to ensure its structural integrity and safe operation:\n\n* **Material Selection:** The standard provides a list of acceptable materials, primarily carbon and stainless steels, chosen based on the stored product, design temperature, and corrosion allowance.\n* **Shell Design:** The thickness of the tank shell plates is calculated based on the hydrostatic pressure of the liquid, the material's allowable stress, and any additional loads from wind or seismic activity.\n* **Bottom Design:** The tank bottom is designed to be uniformly supported by a prepared foundation. For larger tanks, annular plates, which are thicker than the rest of the bottom, are often required to support the weight of the shell.\n* **Roof Design:** The standard covers both fixed-roof and floating-roof designs. Fixed roofs can be self-supporting or supported by a structure, while floating roofs rest on the liquid surface to minimize vapor loss.\n* **Welding and Fabrication:** API 650 specifies detailed requirements for welding procedures, welder qualifications, and fabrication tolerances to ensure the quality and strength of the welds.\n* **Inspection and Testing:** Rigorous inspection and testing are mandated throughout the construction process, including visual inspection, non-destructive testing (NDT) of welds, and a final hydrostatic test to ensure the tank is leak-free and structurally sound.\n\n### Construction Materials\n\nThe primary materials used in the construction of API 650 tanks are:\n\n* **Carbon Steel:** This is the most common material due to its strength and cost-effectiveness. Various grades are specified based on the required toughness and temperature resistance.\n* **Stainless Steel:** Used for storing corrosive products or when product purity is a concern. Different types of stainless steel, including austenitic and duplex, are utilized.\n* **Aluminum:** While less common, aluminum can be used for certain applications.\n\nThe choice of material is a critical aspect of the design process and is determined by a thorough evaluation of the service conditions.\n\n---\nThis video provides a concise overview of 20 essential questions and answers related to API 650 storage tanks, making it a valuable resource for professionals in the field.\n\n[20 Essential Questions and Answers for Storage Tank Professionals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7X1xIHHzs0)"

I have studied the provided document, SANS 10131:2004, \"Above-ground storage tanks for petroleum products,\" and have integrated its contents into my knowledge base.\n\nI understand that this South African National Standard provides recommendations for the safe storage, handling, design, construction, and testing of above-ground petroleum tanks at consumer installations.\n\nI have processed the key details, including:\n* **Scope**: The standard applies to installations with a total capacity under 200 m³ and provides specific design rules for tanks up to 85 m³. It explicitly excludes service stations and the storage of LPG.\n* **Normative References**: It incorporates provisions from other critical standards, such as **API 650** for tank design, API 653 for repair, and various SANS, ASME, and BS standards for components like pipes, flanges, and welding.\n* **Design and Construction**: For tanks up to 85 m³, the standard mandates the detailed requirements outlined in Annex A. This includes material specifications (e.g., carbon steel plate grade 300WA of SANS 1431), welding procedures, tank-end design, and the fabrication of manholes and lifting lugs.\n* **Safety Requirements**: I have noted the critical safety measures, such as:\n    * **Bundling**: Requirements for bund wall construction, capacity (at least the volume of the largest tank), and drainage.\n    * **Safety Distances**: Minimum shell-to-shell distances and distances from property lines, detailed in Tables 1, 2, and 3.\n    * **Fire Safety**: The necessity of 4-hour fire resistance ratings for specific walls and structures, consultation with local fire authorities, and the provision of fire-fighting equipment.\n    * **Venting**: Specifications for breather pipes, normal venting (per API 2000), and emergency venting to prevent tank rupture during a fire.\n* **Testing and Inspection**: Procedures for post-installation testing, including visual inspections, hydrostatic pressure tests, and radiographic testing of welds for quality assurance.\n\nI am prepared to answer any questions you may have regarding the content of this document."
